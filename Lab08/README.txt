This lab was important because it really put a test to
our skill with Finite State Machines. It would actually
be quite fun if I weren't stressing over how many points
I would be getting on this lab. This lab isn't easy at all.

The most important aspect of this lab was mastering Finite
State Machines. I feel like I can write my own Finite State
Machine without assistance, which I suppose is a great thing.
If I had to change something about the lab manual, it would be
the explanation of main(). I was rather lost until a TA came over
to help explain the entirety of main(). Even worse were the helper
functions, which had me at a loss for a complete 30 minutes.

My approach to this lab was to think in terms of Finite State
Machines as much as I could. Creating the Binary Search Tree was
probably the easiest part of this assignment. I went through the lab
manual bit by bit, eventually reading the entire manual over the
course of three days. When I got the basic structure of the FSMs set
up properly, things were smooth. Coding MorseCheckEvents() and main()
was a bit of a nightmare to deal with, and even then, I still wasn't
able to finish it entirely. I'm able to MOSTLY finish it, though.

All in all, I spent a good 12 hours on this assignment. I worked
with a few people in this class, and it was great that I was able to
help them as much as they were able to help me.
