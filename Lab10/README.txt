            Lab 10 -- RPG Game
============================================

This lab focused on working with files and decryption to
create a fully developed text-RPG. The most important part
of this lab was understanding how to manipulate File I/O in
really complicated manners. A lot of hardship and struggling
came out of this assignment, but I think it was worth it.

I started by reading the entire lab manual, front to back,
making sure I didn't miss anything important. It was still
challenging trying to figure out how to start, but eventually
I managed to gain some leeway.

Player.c was extremely straightforward, having few functions
to code. Game.c was terrible to code and extremely challenging,
especially when it came to reading in the room files.
Decryption in general wasn't really that fun when it came to
implementing it. I ended up with a new skill though, so that's
a plus. Also, I coded a video game!

The point distribution is fair, and I learned a lot from this
lab. It's a very valuable lab.
