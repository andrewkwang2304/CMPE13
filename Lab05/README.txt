Happy Valentine's Day!!


So long story short, my LinkedList functions work pretty great--or at
least, I think they do. Had I not procrastinated I probably have finished it. Let
this be a moral lesson to myself not to waste time, but I'll probably use my
late hours to finish the rest of this.

The implementation of the LinkedList functions weren't too difficult.
The pointers were an absolute pain sometimes, but other times, they were
very straightforward.

The main was a bit of a mess. I still have to fix that.

This lab took me about 6 hours. The hardest part was trudging through
the CreateAfter linked list function. That was terrifying beyond belief and 
I pray I never have to do that again, although I probably will when I join
the workforce. The lab manual definitely gave me enough to
start, and the pseudocode for SortedWordCount was a big help.
