/**
 * FieldAddBoat() places a single ship on the player's field based on arguments 2-5. Arguments 2, 3
 * represent the x, y coordinates of the pivot point of the ship.  Argument 4 represents the
 * direction of the ship, and argument 5 is the length of the ship being placed. All spaces that
 * the boat would occupy are checked to be clear before the field is modified so that if the boat
 * can fit in the desired position, the field is modified as SUCCESS is returned. Otherwise the
 * field is unmodified and STANDARD_ERROR is returned. There is no hard-coded limit to how many
 * times a boat can be added to a field within this function.
 *
 * So this is valid test code:
 * {
 *   Field myField;
 *   FieldInit(&myField,FIELD_POSITION_EMPTY);
 *   FieldAddBoat(&myField, 0, 0, FIELD_BOAT_DIRECTION_EAST, FIELD_BOAT_SMALL);
 *   FieldAddBoat(&myField, 1, 0, FIELD_BOAT_DIRECTION_EAST, FIELD_BOAT_MEDIUM);
 *   FieldAddBoat(&myField, 1, 0, FIELD_BOAT_DIRECTION_EAST, FIELD_BOAT_HUGE);
 *   FieldAddBoat(&myField, 0, 6, FIELD_BOAT_DIRECTION_SOUTH, FIELD_BOAT_SMALL);
 * }
 *
 * should result in a field like:
 *  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
 * [ 3 3 3       3 ]
 * [ 4 4 4 4     3 ]
 * [             3 ]
 *  . . . . . . . .
 *
 * @param f The field to grab data from.
 * @param row The row that the boat will start from, valid range is from 0 and to FIELD_ROWS - 1.
 * @param col The column that the boat will start from, valid range is from 0 and to FIELD_COLS - 1.
 * @param dir The direction that the boat will face once places, from the BoatDirection enum.
 * @param boatType The type of boat to place. Relies on the FIELD_POSITION_*_BOAT values from the
 * FieldPosition enum.
 * @return TRUE for success, FALSE for failure
