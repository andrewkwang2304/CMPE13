I hate writing unit testing code.

So long story short, my matrix functions work fine. My mml.c
is an absolute nightmare, though. Going back and forth between creating
perfect solutions--I sympathize for people who actually have to
make these, cause it's not fun. I know it's absolutely necessary,
though. Had I not procrastinated I probably have finisheed it. Let
this be a moral lesson to myself not to waste time.

The implementation of the matrix functions weren't too difficult.
A lot of it relied on double for loops, but if I had unlimited time
I would have used an array of IntegerLists. Or FloatLists, if that
exists.

I ended up writing a significantly messier, much more clunky version
of the mml.c that was probably expected of me. I'm sorry, I could have
done much better.

This lab took me about 6 hours. The hardest part was trudging through
all the printf statements I had to deal with when writing mml.c. That
was terrifying beyond belief and I pray I never have to do that again,
although I probably will. The lab manual definitely gave me enough to
start, although the unit testing part could've given a bit more advice
on dealing with the expected solutions vs the produced solutions.
