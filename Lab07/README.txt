=========================
          Lab 7
=========================

For some reason, there are occassions where the LEDs won't go down
unless you twist the potentiometer a little bit. I don't know why
this happens. I think I fixed it but I'm not too sure.

This lab was really long. Lucky that I started on Friday, and I'm
STILL not done. I'm REALLY close to finishing it, too.

My approach to this lab took a lot of pre-planning. I knew that switch
statements were a major part of this lab, so I took time to write
pseudocode for it. After building the basic skeleton, I began to write
the oven FSM. After finishing a rough version of the FSM, I realized that
a PrintOven function was in order. This turned out to be the hardest part
of the lab. I think finite state machines are really interesting overall,
but I think I need to plan even earlier because I wasn't able to finish a
small part of this lab. Luckily, a vast majority of this lab works fine.

All in all, this lab took 10 hours or so to complete. I disliked anything
that involved printing to the Oled, because that took up a full day's worth
of coding to properly complete it, but this was a very useful lab. I appreciate
how much this lab taught me about this kind of implementation technique.

I collaborated with Alon Uralevich. We assisted each other since he could not
solve his issue with button 3 and I could not solve my issue with button 4.

Good lab. I hope I also get a good grade.
